## Features

- **High-Performance Core**: Powered by `pearl_calculator_core` written in Rust, providing fast and accurate pearl trajectory and TNT explosion calculations.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React + TailwindCSS, offering a smooth and modern user experience.
- **Multifunctional Integration**:
    - **TNT Calculation**: Supports various TNT configurations and arrangements. Quickly calculate with Y-axis offsets.
    - **Simulator**: Built-in pearl trajectory simulation for quick momentum and landing spot prediction.
    - **Configuration Wizard**: Intuitive configuration process for easy cannon setup.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Powered by Tauri, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux. No external dependencies required.

## Usage

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/MliroLirrorsIngenuity/PearlCalculatorRS/releases) page to download the latest version for **your platform**.

Alternatively, visit [pcrs.lolicon.best](https://pcrs.lolicon.best) to experience the installation-free WebAssembly (WASM) version.
> **Note**: The WASM version operates in single-threaded mode, which may result in slightly reduced performance compared to the native application.
